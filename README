drops

Fast paced tiny Game for Linux/PSP

INSTALLATION

You need libsdl-dev on Linux and the pspsdk for PSP (I suggest 'Minimalist PSPSDK' http://minpspw.sourceforge.net/index.html)
On Linux, you may have to edit the source to make it work for your gamepad (near line 66 of 'drops.c').

    > git clone https://github.com/alibabouin/drops.git
    > cd drops

    > # Linux
    > make
    > ./drops

    > # PSP
    > make -f Makefile.psp  # PSP
    > mkdir /path/to/psp/game/drops
    > cp -r media EBOOT.PBP /path/to/psp/game/drops

GAMEPLAY

You are the pinkish circle.
You must not let the little white circles reach you, they want to kill you.
You can collect energy by touching the green circles.
Energy can be used to speed up or create a force field that will destroy any white circle.
Every 500 points, you can go 'berzerk' and kill all enemies on the screen but you will be
whithout energy left.
The game contains 20 levels. When reaching a new level, a bonus will appear on the screen as a
shaking circle.
 - 'SPEED' makes you speed for 3 seconds
 - 'REPEL' repels enemies for 3 seconds
 - 'FREEZE' will freeze enemies for 3 seconds
 - 'BOMB' will detonate a bomb
Enjoy.
